          My dear teacher, as it's Covid19 in the world, and it's difficult to meet each other,
          I looked for many ways to deliever my heart and gratitude
          to you, and choose this way which is my professional way, in the picture I deliever it to the flower :)
          which is you, because you used to discribe yourself as a flower, when were explaining the meaning of parable.
          So what I want to say to you, I know you are very strong and you are leading many people through right way,
          and could take with you through the narrow gate, so whenever you have difficulties you can also teel me,
          and I will help you as I can, so turn the page and see a little gift for you :)
